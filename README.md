# cnasimtools 

A collection of functions to provide slightly more flexible
replacements for code snippets like `ct2df(selectCases(randomCsf(x))` and the like.
Made public in case anyone else finds these
helpful. Not well tested and constantly changing -- use at your own risk.

TODO: refactor noisyDat(), more tools, better documentation
