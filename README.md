# cnasimtools 

A collection of functions to provide slightly more flexible
replacements for code snippets like `ct2df(selectCases(randomCsf(x))` and the like, that I
repeatedly use when testing other in-development `cna`-related code, or as actual
inputs to simulations with `cna`. Made public in case anyone else finds these
helpful. Constantly in development -- use at your own risk.

TODO: more tools, better documentation
