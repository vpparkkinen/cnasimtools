# cnasimtools
A collection of functions to provide slightly more flexible replacements for
code snippets like `ct2df(selectCases(randomCsf(x))` and the like, to simplify
writing simulations using ``CNA``. Made public in case anyone else finds these
helpful. Not well tested and constantly changing -- use at your own risk.
Install from GitHub: ``` remotes::install_github("vpparkkinen/cnasimtools") ```
